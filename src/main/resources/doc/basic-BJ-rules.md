# Blackjack Rules for a Single Player (No Betting) 🎴

## Objective 🎯
Get as close as possible to **21 points** without going over. You play against the **dealer**, trying to have a hand with more points than the dealer without exceeding 21.

## Card Values 🃏
- Number cards (2–10): **face value**
- Face cards (J, Q, K): **10 points**
- Aces: **1 or 11 points**, whichever works best for you

## Setup 🏁
1. Use a standard 52-card deck (you can use more decks for more challenge)
2. Player and dealer each get **two cards**:
    - Dealer shows **one card face up**
    - Dealer keeps **one card face down**

## Gameplay 🎮
### Player's turn
- Choose to **Hit** (draw another card) or **Stand** (keep your current hand)
- If your total exceeds 21, you **bust 💥** and lose automatically

### Dealer's turn
- Dealer reveals the face-down card
- Dealer must **hit until reaching at least 17 points**
- If dealer goes over 21, the dealer **busts 💥**

## Winning 🏆
- If your points are higher than the dealer without going over 21, **you win**
- If the dealer has more points without going over 21, **the dealer wins**
- If both have the same points, it’s a **push (tie) 🤝**

## Blackjack ✨
- If your first two cards are **an Ace and a 10-value card**, you have a **Blackjack**, the best possible hand
